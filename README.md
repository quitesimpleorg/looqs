qss
=========
qss creates a poor-man full-text search for your files using a
sqlite database.

A simple gui (C++ with Qt5) for search  is found in gui/. 
It shows preview pages of documents where your search keywords have 
been found. This allows you to search all indexed pdfs and take a look
at the pages side by side in an instant.
